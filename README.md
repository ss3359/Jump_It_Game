# Jump_It_Game
This is a C++ Coding Exercise creating a Jump-It array game. The object of the game is to move from the first column to the last column with the lowest total cost. The number in each column represents the cost to enter a column. You always start the game in the first position in the array and hav e only two types of moves. Either you can move to the adjacent column or jump over to the position two spots over the current position in the array. 

Let me know if I need any changes. Thank you for reading this!
